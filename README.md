# DomainValueExtractor
From user input of a domain name, extract email addresses into a new file. 

The 'DomainValueExtractor' script is a Python tool designed to extract values associated with a specified domain from an input file containing email addresses and their corresponding values. The user provides a domain name, and the script scans the input file, identifying email addresses belonging to the specified domain. It then extracts the values associated with these email addresses and writes them, along with the respective email addresses, to an output file. This tool is useful for quickly organizing and isolating data related to a specific domain from a large dataset.
